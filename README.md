Cleaning and analysing Olive Sales data and creating a report in PowerBI

## Introduction

Olive Sales is a fictional business involved in the sells of automobiles, train, ships and planes. This project was created due to an interest in the automobile industry as well as working with data which insights would be interesting to see.

- Insight/Solutions
- Conclusion

## Report Requirement
While planning for this project the initial purpose of creating the report was to see which product category made the most sales & profits, how the sales & profits were made year over year and how each product category performed in different countries.

However, during the report design I was also interested in creating a report that tracks how each sales person performed. 

In summary, the report requirement was to provide an overall sales performance by product category and each sales person's activity.

## Insight/Solution
After cleaning the data with excel and analysing it with PowerBI, attached below is the report.

From the report, it was revealed that the year 2004 had the most sales. Classic cars provided most of these sales followed by vintage cars. USA had the highest customer purchase followed by France and  November been the most successful month.

## Conclusion
This was a fun project to work on. You can explore the interactive version of the report to see the full functionality and User Experience through the link provided below.
